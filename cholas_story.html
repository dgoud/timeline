                                <p>The king was the head of the administration and was considered a representative of God. Their idols were kept in temples.The Chola kings built enormous temples and envisioned them in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centers of economic activity. Chola king was the chief justice. The village level judicial administration was carried on by the village assembly</p>

                                <p>Various kinds of officers looked after the administration of the Cholas. While we are not sure if the council of ministers existed, Uddan-kottam might have this function. The Cholas possessed a body of executive officers (udan-kuttam). These officials acted as coordinators between the King and the bureaucrats. The ministerial council and the administrative staff jointly run the administration of the State under the Cholas. The King relied on the head of departments for decision-making. Officers were honoured and encouraged by titles that contributed to the efficiency of the administration. This period also marked the foundation of local self-governments. The chiefs had a significant position in the State. The chiefs of the Chola period were:</p>

                            <p>It seems that they were allotted land and collected taxes in exchange for padi kaval. They kept their own armed forces and retainers. The administrative hierarchy during this period had mobility. The officials in the Perundanan category were of the higher position, and Sirutaram were of the lower category. The armyâ€™s commanding officer was Senapati in the middle category, Sirudanattup Perundaram. The judges or Nyayattar belonged to either of the categories. The term Atikari denoted a different class of officers. The titles given to various responsible persons were:</p>

                                <p>The Chola Empire was divided into nine provinces which were also called mandalams and was headed by viceroy. Close relatives of kings were appointed as viceroys. The Viceroys were in constant touch with the Central Government and sent regular replies to the king. Generally mandalams were named after the original names or the titles of the Chola kings. Each mandalam was divided into a number of Kottams or Valanadus which were again subdivided into nadu. Each nadu was further divided into (Urs) villages which form part of the last unit of the administration. Nadu was one of the important administrative units of the Cholas. Nadus had representative assemblies and the heads of the nadus were called Nattars. The council of nadu was called nattavai. Representatives of the Nattavais and nattars promoted agriculture. They also took care of the protection of the people and tax collection.</p>

                                <h4>Village Administration</h4>
                                <p>The entire responsibility of the village administration was in the hands of the village assembly called Grama Sabha. The lowest unit of the Chola administration was the village unit. The village assemblies looked after the maintenance of peace, tanks, roads, public ponds revenue collection, judiciary, education and temples. The village assemblies were in charge of the payment of taxes due from the villages to the treasury. They regulated public markets and helped people at times of fathine and flood. Assemblies provided provisions for education.They maintained law and order in every village. Village Assemblies carried on village administration effectively with the help of variyams. Male members of the society were the members of these variyams. Niyaya variyam administered justice, Thottavariyam looked after flower gardens,The Dharma variyam looked after charities and temples, Erivariyam was in charge of tanks and water supply, The pon variyam was in charge of the finance,The Gramakariya variyam looked after the works of all committees,The members of these varivams were known as â€œVarivaperumakkal. The village officials were paid salary either in cash or in kind. Good functioning of these variams increased the efficiency of the local administration of the Cholas.</p>

                                <p>Brahmadeyas comprised a class of landholding Brahmanas without tax obligations. They organised as a separate group. Nagaram included traders and artisans who were in the trading business. Nagarattar embodied traders, while Nagaram was a distinct area. The committee of nagarattar was nagaravariyam. They also assigned taxes such as a tax on land or Kadamai, tax for sustenance, or nagaraviniyogam. There were situations when Nagaram was autonomous.</p>

                                <h3>Trade and Taxation</h3>
                                <p>The inscriptions of this period suggest that a very elaborate revenue and bureaucratic structure was put into place by the late 10th Century. These systems were handled by two kinds of officials - important functionaries like the proto-bureaucratic and others who could be called bureaucratic officials. </p>
                                <p>The government and local authorities gave special attention to agricultural prosperity. One-third of the production was demanded as land revenue by the State. Land revenue assessment and classification of land were revised regularly. Unpaid labour was frequently employed. Public expenditure was made towards the King and the court, civil, administrative staff, roads, army, and navy. There were cantonments, and the army was trained and disciplined. A grant of village land by the King is recorded in writing, signed by four office secretaries, and entered in the accounts register. The entry was made by the tax department officers and other officers who are called the â€˜maintainers of tax systems.â€™ There were committees formed to levy taxes and fines on the construction and maintenance of canals, tanks, and embankments. A general tax called Natacci / Uracci refers to taxes on residential spaces and common areas. This indicates the proper administrative procedure in the play.</p>

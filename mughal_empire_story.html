                                <p>Similar to the Indian traditions, Islamic view of an emperor was that he should be strong and just. The elements of divinity are once again seen in the history of India under Mughals with their jharokha darshan. The Mughal administration derived their place and authority from the absolute emperor. The whole administrative system viewed the emperor as a generous ruler, working for the welfare of the subjects. He was all commanding and the ultimate source of authority and the justice provider.</p>

                                <h4>Wikalat and Wazirat</h4>
                                <p>These offices under wakil and wazir, had its roots in the Caliph system under Abbasids. The office of the wazir was rejuvenated under the early Mughals. In the reign of Babur, wazir Nizamuddin Muhammad Khalifa was entrusted with civil and military powers. The Wazir of Humayun, Hindu Beg was vested with enormous powers. During Bairam Khan’s regency of four years the office of wakil and wazir gathered unrestrained powers. However, financial powers of the wakil were soon taken away by Akbar and given to diwan-i kul.</p>

                                <p>After Akbar’s consolidation of diwan the diwan-i kul was entrusted with revenue and finances. He supervised the imperial treasury and was in charge of the accounts, reviewed payments of every office. The diwan of the provincial level were under him. He was also responsible for the validation of revenue documents. In fact, the whole income and expenditure system was supervised by him. The ministry looking after the revenue at the centre comprised various departments such as diwan-i khalisa, diwan-i tan, diwan-i jagir, diwan-i-buyutat. These departments then contained a number of units with superintendents, secretary, and clerks. The mustaufi, mushrif, and khazanadar were auditor, chief accountant, and Imperial treasurer respectively.</p>

He was responsible for looking after the assignment, salary and other works related to the mansabdars including supervising dagh and chehra practice. He also brought the military department’s affairs before the emperor. The office of the provincial level bakhshis and waqai navis reported to him. Apart from these duties he often accompanied the emperor on his various trips. He also looked after army recruitments and strategized during battles.</p>

He was the head in control for the purchase and storage for the royal household. He also administered the manufacture of various articles. Although he had to report directly to the emperor for money matters, he communicated to diwan. There were a number of officers under him, including the diwan-i buyutat and tahvildar (treasurer).</p>

He also distributed charities and grants, wazifa, suyurghal, inam, madad-i ma’ash. In the early period as the head of the judicial department, sadr-us sudur administered appointments of qazis and muftis. During Aurangzeb’s reign, offices of the qazi-ul quzzat and the sadr-us sudur got separated. This decreased the power of sadr. He was now in charge of assigning grants. He also looked into whether the grants were given to the right persons and utilized properly. He was also responsible for distribution of Alms.</p>

                                <h3>Provincial Administration</h3>                                
                                <p>During the reign of Akbar, the empire was divided into Subas or provinces. Key officials of Suba include Subedar, diwan, Bakshi, miradl (qazi), sadr, kotwal, mirbahr (in charge of port duties, customs, etc.) and waqia navis.</p>

                                <ul class="report-list" style="list-style: disc; margin-left:30px;">
                                    <li>Subedar: The subas are headed by a Subedar (governor or sipahsalar). Hakim and Nazim were some other names for Subedar. However, during the course of time, subedar became a more familiar title for this office. The Governor enjoyed considerable power as far as provincial administration was concerned. In 1586-87, a new practice of appointing two governors for each Suba was started. According to Abul Fazl, in the case of the inability, the other could take his place. But the practice was done away with after some time. Separation of power among important officials was strictly enforced at the provincial level, </li>
                                    <li>Diwan: Functions of Diwan were similar to central diwan ( diwan-i kul). Provincial Diwan was in charge of all matters concerning the revenue administration and was assisted in his duty by several officials, such as Amin, Qanungo, Chaudhari, and Muqqddam. These officials assisted in the revenue administration of Parganas and villages. He had to report to the central diwan. The position of diwan in the suba was independent of that of the governor. This separation of power kept a check on the powers of the governor.</li>
                                    <li>Bakshi was another vital official in the province who carried out the task assigned by Mir Bakshi, or central Bakshi.</li>
                                    <li>Sadr was the representative of central Sadr at the provincial level. He was responsible for the welfare of those engaged in religious activities and learning. As he was considered a learned person, he was entrusted with the judiciary’s work and, in that capacity, supervised the work of qazis appointed at lower-level administrative divisions.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Waqai navis were agents of the emperor in the provinces and kept him informed on any development happening in the provinces</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>In every Suba, a number of faujdars were appointed. From the sources, it does not appear very clear whether faujdari jurisdiction corresponded to a sarkar’s territorial jurisdiction under normal circumstances. Faujdari was an administrative division, whereas sarkar was a territorial and revenue division. Sometimes a faujdar was appointed to take charge of two adjoining sarkars even if these belonged to two different subas. Sometimes they were selected over areas covering several Parganas within a sarkar. Faujdar was responsible for maintaining law and order and collecting revenue from their jurisdiction timely. They were assisted in revenue affairs by the amalguzar. Faujdars were appointed by imperial decree. According to the Persian manuscript of Farrukhabad, the Mughal provincial governors were required to recruit and train about 100 young men each year for appointment as officers, first in the provinces and then at the imperial court.</p>

                                <p>At the sarkar level, faujdar and the amalguzar were important administrators. The Faujdar headed the Sarkar and maintained law and order. His chief responsibility was to safeguard subjects under his jurisdiction. He also kept vigil over rebels and disobedient zamindars. The amil or amalguzar held an important position as a revenue collector. His main responsibility was assessment and supervision of revenue collection with the assistance of his subordinate officers. Amil was expected to bring more land under cultivation, and persuade cultivators to pay taxes.

                                <p>The next administrative unit after the Sarkar was the pargana headed by shiqqdar who helped the amils in collecting revenue. The pargana level administration pf revenue collection as saslo the responsibility of the amils. His obligations matched to that of amalguzar at the sarkar level. The land records of the area under him were kept by qanungos. At the bottom of administrative system was the village unit headed by muqaddam whereas the village records were kept by the patwari.</p>

                                <p>In the organization of the Mughal military, the mansab system was vital in which administrators and cavalry were employed. Similarly significant was the essential divisions of the army. In the mansabdari system the officials holding a mansab were expected to provide soldiers to the state’s military service. They were categorized into thirty-three grades of importance and salary which could be in cash or through jagir revenue. </p> 
                                <p>
                                    The Mughals organized their military similar to that of Mongols on a decimal system. Although there was a difference that unlike Mongols, the Mughal military was under the direct command of the emperor. The military had divisions of infantry, elephantry, artillery and navy. The military was heterogeneous comprising Persians, Turks, Afghans, and Rajputs. The piyadagan or infantry comprised bandukchi, shamsheerbaz, dakhilis, spearman, archers, etc. The personal soldiers of the emperor were known as Ahadis. The dakhili soldiers were under the mansabdars on directive of the emperor. They were of two categories – bargirs receiving their needs from the state; and silehdars bringing horses and weapons of their own. The horses and horsemen under the Mansabdars were regularly called for dagh-o-chehra. It was a practice for horse branding and horsemen description for ones receiving naqadi or cash while 36 months for those who were jagirdars. Mir atish was in charge of the artillery.

                                <p>The Mughal emperor was himself the Commander-in-chief while the military department’s head was Bakhshi-i Mumalik or Mir Bakhshi who issued grants to mansabdars. The palace guards were also under his command. Three bakhshis looked after the whole empire. The first bakhshi carried out duties similar to the mir bakhshi except some changes, the second bakhshi was responsible for looing into matters of lower rank mansabdars, whereas the third bakhshi’s duties included taking care of payments and postings of yaumiya daran</p>

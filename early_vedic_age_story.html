He was the protector of the cattle, fought wars, and offered prayers to gods. There was a modest civil system of territorial administration because of continuous migration. There were no regular taxes, and people offered voluntary tributes known as Bali.</p>

                                <p>Neither the king nor the samitis claimed and exercised legislative powers in the Vedic period. Laws were either sacred or secular. They were based on sacred text and customs and traditions. This continued till the age of smritis. It is believed that the Dharamshastra as well as Nitishastra are promulgated by the creator and it is the king’s duty to enforce the rules laid down in them, and not to introduce any changes on his own authority</p>

                                <h3>Vedic Assemblies During Rig Vedic Times</h3>
                                <p>According to Vedic literature, there were three popular assemblies known as Vidatha, Sabha, and Samiti. Vidatha, along with Gana and Parishad, appears to be older than Sabha and Samiti (Sharma 1953, p. 93. The assemblies- Sabha and Samiti, were formed as an essential element of the government and exercised considerable authority, and kept a check on the king’s powers. Sabha Pati acted as guardian of the assembly hall. The Samiti, where Sam + iti means ‘meeting together,’ also represents an assembly. This concept forms the idea of an assembly for electing or re-electing a King. This shows that they were a sovereign body from the constitutional point of view. The Atharva Veda and the Rig Veda have prayers for common Samiti, which is related to the State’s common policy. This can be elaborated further as ‘a common aim and a common mind’. The king was supposed to attend the Samiti, which was emphasised in the Rig Veda, or else he would be considered ‘untrue.’ The king’s attendance for the Samiti was supposed to continue until the Samiti existed, which seems similar to the concept of the Parliament. During deliberations, speakers would make speeches that would be agreeable to the Samiti and prove their skills. These elements are also described expressly in the Atharva Veda. The duration of these Samitis is precisely defined in the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda and subsequently by the Chhandogya Upanishad. Beyond the Vedic period, the same institution was known as Parishad, as mentioned in Paraskara-Grihya-Sutra, later applied to the Sabha. The Sabha would usually mean ‘a body of men shining together,’ and they would together choose a president called Sabha-pati. One of the primary functions of the Sabha was to act as the national judicature. The judicial Sabha of the monarch, as seen later, kept elements of its popular roots and certain key popular aspects in its administration of justice.</p>

                                <h4>Gana</h4>
                                <p>According to Mahabharata, Gana refers to the whole body politic, the entire Political Community, and in the alternative, the Parliament, and not to the “Governing body” only (Dr. Thomas). The Governing body was composed of Gana-mukhyas and Pradhana (Chiefs and President respectively), whose jurisdiction was to conduct the community’s affairs. Resolutions of the State remained in their hands; they conducted meetings and debated these resolutions. They witnessed the administration of justice as well. As a result, the executive was a unique entity inside the Gana. The Vedas support the tradition of the first monarchy, but the Aiteraya Brahmana supports the tradition of monarchy being rejected and democratic forms of governance being established. The thought process also supported a system in which the State is perceived to be founded on contract, and the ruler is viewed as a servant of the ruled. It also discussed voting and ballot-voting, motion, resolution, legislation, legalism, and formalism as a deliberative mechanism. Gana was praised in the Mahabharata’s Shanti Parva for its excellent foreign policy, large treasury, ready army, fighting skills, good laws, and discipline. The Mahabharata mentions a similar notion as the Gana and claims that the primary issue in the Gana constitution was keeping a resolution secret due to their enormous number. Thus, important policy matters would be discussed only among a few leaders, which is something like the Cabinet.</p>

                                <h4>Parishad</h4>
                                <p>Parishad, a powerful group, was established to advise the monarch on contested areas of law and other matters- religious, political, and judicial. It was made up of at least 10 Brahmanas: four men who had thoroughly studied the four Vedas, three men from each of the three classes (a student, a householder, and an ascetic), one who knew the Mimamsa, one who knew the Angas, and a teacher of sacred law. These guys were all well-educated, reasoning-skilled, and materialism-free, and they were also expected to do administrative responsibilities.</p>

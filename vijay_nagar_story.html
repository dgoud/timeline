                                <h3>King At The Centre</h3>
                                <p>Nilakanta Sastri believes that theoretically, there was a hereditary monarchy and the political environment within the state and outside demanded that the King be very diplomatic and powerful. There existed a council of ministers for advising the King, but the King had the ultimate authority. The King’s army was divided into divisions of elephant force, cavalry and infantry, usually stationed at the capital city. Because of the large standing army, the kingdom became a more centralized polity than the previous south Indian Hindu states. The Capital city had two treasuries. The first one was for payment and withdrawal, while the second one was an emergency reserve. According to the famous traveller, Nuniz noticed that Achyutadevaraya hired officers to record and collect the income from lands surrounding the city; however, there is no evidence to prove it. There is no indication that the kings or administration directly controlled economic production. The investments from the centre in productive pursuits were diverse depending on the product and were enabling instead of forced.</p>

                                <h3>Provinces, Sime, Sthala</h3>
                                <p>The kingdom was divided into rajyas, or provinces, which served as administrative entities. The rajyas were assigned to pradhanis or top officers. The job of pradhanis was previously held by princes of the royal family, but military officers eventually took it over. Each Rajya’s headquarters were known as uccavadi or simply Cavadi. Rajyas were significant revenue and administrative entities. When the Nayak system was founded during Krishnadevayara’s reign, the rajyas ceased to act as key administrative units. Later, the previous rajyas’ headquarters and several smaller towns are found as walled garrisons under the command of military officers known as amara nayakas. Aside from the rajyas, there were lesser divisions such as sime, sthala, nadu, etc. Surprisingly, the terms rajya and sime are used alternately in some records, as in Terekanambi sime and Terekenanbi rajya. Some of these divisions, such as Kundahatta Sthala of Nagavali Sthala, exist within another division with an identical territorial title. Government officials created an unusual nomenclature system for distinguishing various territorial divisions for administrative convenience. On the other hand, the alterations show how the pattern of administrative machinery has changed through time.</p>

                                <h3>Nayaka System</h3>
                                <p>The Vijayanagar Kingdom followed the Nayaka system for officers appointed by the King. The Nayakas were a class of officers selected by the King and given land rights. The Nayakas had complete control over the land they owned, allowing them to lease a portion of it to others in exchange for revenue and other services to the higher authority. Nayakattanam was the name given to the area given to the Nayakas. In exchange for the King’s land, the Nayakas were required to have men ready to be dispatched to combat and remit a share of their territory’s revenue to their superior. According to epigraphical documents, there were three types of Nayakas: </p>
                                <ul class="report-list">
                                    <li>Dan-nayakas (military official)</li>
                                    <li>Durga-dannayakas (military officials in control of the fort), and</li>
                                    <li>Amara-nayakas (military official in charge of the palace).</li>
                                   
                                </ul>
                                <p>Brahman commanders known as Durga-dannayakas were in control of strategic castles. The Nayakas maintained control over output in their Nayakattannam areas by encouraging settlers such as farmers, artisans, and other service groups, all of whom received tax breaks. Nayakas were required to appear at the royal headquarters. The agents or Karyakarta guarded their territory. The institution of Nayakattanam involved a land tenure system consisting of three tenurial rights, Amaram, Bhandaravada and Manya. </p>
                                <p>1. Amaram: Nayaka gave the land to Amarnayaka, who is a Sub-nayaka. He was in charge of troop maintenance. The land was developed with the help of Kaniyalar, who employed Kudi, primary cultivators, and forced labour. He was required to offer the Nayaka a set percentage of his earnings.</p>
                                <p>2. Bhadra: Bhandaravada was the name given to the territory under the direct control of the Nayaka. He engaged cultivators on the property known as Kaniyalarin in Tamil and Garuda Praje in Kannada.</p>
                                <p>3.Manya: Tax-free land was provided to temples and other religious institutions. Manya was the name given to such donations.</p>

                                <h3>Ayangar System</h3>
                                <p>The Ayangar system was used to organize the kingdom. Every hamlet was treated as a separate entity under this arrangement. In each village, the government chose twelve bureaucrats called collectively ‘Ayangar.’ Once assigned, the position of Ayangar became hereditary. The Ayangars had a great deal of control over their domains. They have the option to sell or mortgage their office. In addition, they were given tax-free lands, known as Manyas, to ensure their long-term survival. Headmen (Maniyam, Reddi, or Gauda), accountants (Karnam, Senabhova), and watchmen are among the Ayangars (Talaiyari). They possessed ownership of Manya lands. They had rights to tax-free plots of village land (Manya), from which they received a portion of the village’s profits. They may, however, have paid a quit-rent (rent paid instead of income share received as rights over tax-free land). Other village servants, such as the potter, blacksmith, and carpenter, who performed necessary services for the community but did not undertake administrative tasks, were also awarded income shares. Umbili, Kodage, and Srotriya were the names given to these income shares. These agricultural production income shares were not taxed but instead acted as compensation for other services rendered. Suvarndaya, Kasu Kadamai, was the term for payments in kind, whereas Danyadaya, Kasu Kadamai, was for payments in money</p>

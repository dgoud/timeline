                                <h3>Form Of Government</h3>
                                <p>Just as seen in the earlier Vedic period, it is evident from the writings of Megasthenes that the tradition of Samiti, Sabha and Parishad existed at one point even during kingship but was later changed to democratic government set up. Towards the end of the Vedic period, constitution was defined by the following terms:</p>
                                <p>1. Do-Rajjani meaning meant two rulers ruling a state and 
                                    2. Gana-Rayani means rule by numbers or rule by many, which was also called as Gana-Rajya. 
                                    </p>
                                <p>Since a practice similar to counting votes was the norm in Gana, it was clear that, as republics were governed by parliament, the Gana came to mean a republic itself. Panini also mentions the word Samgha, which denotes Gana, as a republic beyond doubt. Gana rule is opposed to royal rule in the Avadana-Sataka. The Jataka mentions LIchchhavi rulers as ‘Gana rulers’ or republican rules and the constitution of the Lichchhavis has mentioned about the document Attha-Katha, where it talks about the following four highest officers:</p>
                                <ul class="report-list">
                                    <li>The President (Raja)</li>
                                    <li>The Vice-President (Upa-Raja)</li>
                                    <li>The Generalissimo (Sena-pati) and</li>
                                    <li>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Bhanda-garika)</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>The Cabinet was made up of these four posts, and the government was housed at the city of Vaishali, which had triple defences. The authority (Rajjam) was vested in the residents (Vasantanam), who numbered around 7700 founding families and were all eligible to govern (Rajunam, ‘Kings’). In the parliament, these Vaishalians discussed serious issues related to:</p>

                                <h3>Administration</h3>
                                <h4>Monarchical Administration</h4>
                                <p>In the Age of the Sixteen MahaJanapadas, kingship was generally hereditary, but the king used to be elected by the people in some instances. The power of the king was not unlimited. The king carried out his administration with the help of officials, both high and low. Higher officials called mahamatras performed the functions of minister (mantrin), commander (Senanayaka), judge, chief accountant and head of the royal harem. A class of officials called ayuktas also performed similar functions in some states. Brahmans exercised significant influence in the monarchical form of government. The Brahmanas of that time were repositories of culture and education and were held in the highest esteem. In some kingdoms such as Koshala and Magadha, despite punch-marked coins made of silver, some influential Brahmanas and sethis were paid by the grant of the revenue of villages. The beneficiaries were granted only revenue and they were not given any administrative authority. The rural administration was in the hands of the village headman and was known by different titles such as grambhojaka, gramini or gramika. The headman enjoyed considerable importance and had direct links with the kings. He collected the taxes from the villagers, and they also maintained law and order in their locality. The king possessed a sizeable professional army fed by the state exchequer. The fiscal system was well established, and Kshatriya and Brahmanas were exempted from tax payment. A voluntary payment called Bali by peasants to the king was compulsory and collected by officers called balisadhakas. Taxes were paid in both cash and kind. Taxes were assessed and managed by the royal agents with the help of the village headman. Artisans had to work for a day in a month for the king, and traders had to pay customs on the sale of their commodities.</p>
                                
                            </div>

                                <h4>Republican Administration</h4>
                                <p>The administrative machinery of Shakya and Lichchavis consisted of Raja, Uparaja(vice king), Senapati (commander), and bhandagarika(treasurer). The Licchavis Republic had seven courts in a hierarchical order for trying the same case one after the other. The common people had no say in the administration. But the republican tradition is as old as the Age of Buddha.</p>

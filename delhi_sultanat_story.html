                                <h3>Sultan, Amirans And Ulema</h3>                                
                                <p>The Delhi Sultanate had an administrative system where the Sultan was at the apex, ruling and administering a large territory with the assistance of amirans (nobles), ministers, officers, and various others. With absolute powers, he was the legal head of the state, the chief of the army- leading forces into victories, and had ultimate authority in Judicial matters. Even during Ruknuddin Firuz, Muizzuddin Bahram, Alauddin Masud, and Nasiruddin Mahmud, when nobles became more powerful, Sultan was still the functionary head of the Sultanate. His position was often under pressure from the influential group of nobles and religious leaders. This group, known as Turkan-i Chihilgani or corps of forty, was introduced by Iltutmish, who selected Turkish slaves, trained and then employed them for their excellent administration, among other qualities. During the reign of Muizzuddin Bahram corps of forty became very influential and formed naib-i mamalakat, an equivalent centre of power to destabilize the Sultan's power. Later, Sultan Balban, a member of such a group, dealt with them ruthlessly after ascending the throne. </p>
                                <p>The Sultan was absolute authority, but there were checks and balances, too: Interestingly there were times when few Sultans disobeyed the Islamic law, Shariat.</p>

                                <h4>Nobles</h4>
                                <p>The nobles of the Delhi Sultanate were of high social status. In the early days, nobles generally included military commanders who came to India with the conquering forces. Their strength increased over time, along with the inclusion of some indigenous groups of India. The status and power of the Sultanate nobles grew with time, and there were times when they enjoyed more power in reality than the ruling Sultan, but these events were irregular and short-livedThe Sultanate nobility was heterogeneous in composition and divided into factions with clashing interests. During the early period of the Delhi Sultanate, only the Turks were preferred; however, in the times of Khilji and Tughlaqs, various other groups were also included. During Muhammad Tughlaq, people from lower strata too could join and elevate to higher ranks. For which Ziauddin Barani, the historian, complained about how Peera, the gardener and Maqbul, a slave, were promoted to high post. The Lodi period saw the Afghan concept of only first among equals, where the nobles and Sultan had equal status.</p>

                                <h4>Ulemas</h4>
                                <p>Ulema was a group comprising scholars of Islam who looked after the religious affairs and interpreted Islamic laws for the Sultan. Important officials such as Sadr-us sudur, shaikh-ul Islam, qazi, mufti muhtasib, imam and khatib were selected from this theological class. They received grants from and, in exchange, provided legitimacy to the ruling class. They were very influential in matters of religion as well as politics. The judicial affairs of the state were also their responsibility employed as Qazis at different levels of judicial administration. They were also influential in pressurizing Sultans to rule according to Islam law. Yet few Sultans like Allaudin Khilji often disobeyed them and chose secular options. Although the Sultans acknowledged the authority of the Shariat, they also added secular zawabit.</p>

                                    <li>Diwan-i-Mazalim - In the Sultan's absence, it was led by Amir-i-Dad. He was in charge of the Qadis, Kotwals (police), and Muhtasibs (Executive officers who supervised and enforced the public morals and public conveniences).</li>
                                    <li>Smaller Departments - At the centre, there were several lesser 'departments' that assisted in the empire's day-to-day administration. The Sultan was generally in charge of them directly. Those in charge of intelligence [such as the Barid-i-Mumalik], the royal household [directed by the Wakil-i-Dar], court ceremonies [managed by the Amir-i-Hajib], and royal bodyguards [under the Sar-i-Jandar] were all important positions. Slaves, royal workshops [Karkhanas], and key royal slaves performed various responsibilities such as bearing the royal parasol, serving wine, and so on were all taken care of by other important departments.</li>

                                <h3>Provincial And Local Administration</h3>  
                                <p>In the early days, Sultanate was divided into iqtas distributed to nobles. Later these became subas, provinces. There were around 24 provinces under Muhammad Tughlaq. Each province was placed under a governor named wali or muqti to maintain law and order and collect revenue. They kept a percentage for themselves and their troops' salary. They were independent in the beginning but later were closely scrutinized. The provinces were further divided into shiqs. The shiqdars administered them. Later shiqs got transformed into sarkars in the Afghan period. As a territorial unit, the sarkar comprised many Parganas and was headed by amil. The Parganas consist of many villages. The village headman was known as muqaddam or Chaudhari. The governor's responsibilities included overseeing revenue collection, maintaining peace and order, and suppressing opposition to a central authority. He was the Sultan's delegated chief executive officer in the kingdom's provinces, and he embodied the Sultan's administrative power. As remuneration, the governor receives a portion of the revenue collected. As a result, it was in the governor's best interests to secure proper and timely revenue collection. A set of bureaucrats was in charge of the communities. Muquddam (the local chief), Patwari (the village accountant), and Khot (village headman). Local authorities such as Khot, Muqaddam, Patwari, and Choudhary worked with the governor to collect revenue and maintain peace and order, among other things. In other circumstances, the governor was assisted in his duties by a local ruler known by various names such as rai, rana, rawat, raja, and so on. These rulers were normally recognized as subordinates by the Sultan in the centre, but they also had sovereign authority over the centre's administrative operations. This approach permitted the Sultan to broaden his geographical reach while maintaining nominal sovereignty and a guaranteed financial commitment to the royal treasury. The khots and muqaddams were given few privileges and lived luxurious life. Nevertheless, they came under scrutiny in the reign of Allaudin Khilji. Delhi, the capital, was important, and so was its administration. We are informed that under the Sultans, the city was divided into Lashkargah and Shahr. The kotwal was in charge of keeping the fort's keys and the city. Tajuddin was one of the first kotwal.</p> 
                                <p>The other important officers in the provinces were the Barids, Shiqs, Faujdar, Qazi, Amil, Amin.</p>

                                <ul class="report-list-disc">
                                    <li>The Sultan of the local development used to report to Barids, who were intelligence operatives and reporters. They were appointed directly by the Sultan. They served as a vital check on provincial governors. </li>
                                    <li>The shiqdar was in charge of the shiq and also aided the governor in maintaining law and order, particularly in criminal justice, military support, land revenue collection, and repression of local revolt. His responsibilities also included the supervision of paragana.</li>
                                    <li>Faujdar had similar functions as shiqdar.</li>
                                    <li>Kotwal worked under the supervision of Faujdar and was responsible for maintaining law and order.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The shiqdar and Faujdar were helped by some local officials such as Qazi, Amil, and Amin. Qazi was responsible for dealing with civil cases and acted as a jurisconsult</p>
                                <ul class="report-list-disc">
                                    <li>Amil was primarily responsible for the collection of the revenue.</li>
                                    <li>Amin measured land in the reign of Sikandar Lodi </li>
                                    <li>Kotwal was placed under Faujdar and was responsible for maintaining law and order.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The Sahib-i-Diwan was in charge of keeping track of the province income and spending. On the advice of Wazir, he was appointed by the Sultan. Mutassarifs and Karkuns assisted him. The Nazir and Waquf were in charge of tax collection and expenditure, respectively. Khwaja was yet another key official (probably the same as Sahib-i-Diwan). On the advice of Wazir, he was appointed by the Sultan. He kept a record of the iqta's earnings. The Sultan was able to make revenue demands based on this income. Because the Sultanate's agricultural produce was not consistent, the taxation structure and demand for different sections of the Sultanate varied based on the productivity of the area.</p>

                                <h3>Revenue Administration</h3>                              
                                <p>During the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, the Indian subcontinent's economy was primarily agricultural. As a result, land revenue was the principal source of income. The state used to own vast swaths of land known as Khalisa. Farmers tilled the Khalisa fields, which the centre oversaw. Amils carried the earnings from such territories to the central treasury. However, the majority of the area was divided into Iqta holdings. Various types of lands under the Delhi Sultanate and these lands were divided into three divisions -</p> 

                                <ul class="report-list-disc">
                                    <li>Iqta land: lands given to officials as a form of iqta rather than payment for their services.</li>
                                    <li>Khalisa land was under the direct control of the Sultan, and the money was used to maintain the royal court and royal household.</li>
                                    <li>Inam land was land that was assigned or granted to religious leaders or religious institutions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Barani, in his Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi, describes the agricultural policy in North India during the reign of Alauddin Khalji. According to the text, three taxes were levied on the peasants by the Sultan, viz. the Kharaj (also called Kharaj-I-jizya) or cultivation tax; Charai, a tax on milch cattle; and Ghari (a tax on houses). kharaj was the land tax, and the lands of all sizes were subject to the procedure of measurement of land called masahat and fixation of the yield per biswa(wafa-I-biswa). Generally, the tax was collected in cash though sometimes collected in kind for specific purposes.</p>

                                <h4>Grants (Iqta, Milk, Idrar)</h4>                              
                                <p>Iqta was a land grant made from the Kharaj land to officers called Muqti. Iqta was not hereditary and did not entitle the Muqti to the right of ownership. Iqta could be transferred and revoked by the Sultans. Jizya revenue of Iqta was assigned yearly, whereas non-Jizya revenue was granted for many. The Muqti was assigned the duty of collecting the revenue and utilizing it for maintaining troops for the Sultan. The Muqti alloted smaller iqtas for maintaining their troops. The surplus from the iqta lands was sent to the central treasury. The Sultan assigned revenue of villages or lands for a lifetime to the religious institutions. The assignments were in the form of milk (proprietary rights given by the state), idrar (pension) and inam (gift). Waqf were the grants to support religious institutions like madrasas and khanqahs. The Sultan made these grants both within iqta and khalisa through a Farman. These grants didn't put much pressure on the exchequer.</p>

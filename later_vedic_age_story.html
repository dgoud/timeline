                                <h3>Textual Evidence Of Administrative Design</h3>
                                <p>The literature suggests that the later vedic polity was way ahead of its time compared to the global administration system. Mention of Guara-Siras in the Mahabharata and Aditya in Asvalayana Grihya-Sutra proves the study of politics had been undertaken and implemented from the times even before the Vedic period and way before Kautilya’s Arthashastra. The documentation of practical governance and political conjectures is the “principle of government” and was initially known as Danda-Niti. Later on, it was also known as Arthasastra or the ‘Code of Common-Wealth.’ At the time Arthashastra and Usanas, commonly known as Danda-Niti was adopted in the famous works of Brihaspati.</p>
                                <p>Danda-Niti is also referred to as the encyclopedia in the Mahabharata, ascribed to Prajapati with subjects such as the “Raja-Dharma’ or ‘Raja-Sastra’ or ‘Law for the Ruler’ or ‘Code for the Rulers’ (as allured in Shanti Parva) . The fact remains that the authors of the Vedic period were considered divine and mythological in the Shanti Parva. However, Kautilya has mentioned them as historical persons who contributed immensely to the literature on Hindu Politics. The book ascribed to Sukra called as Sukra-Niti the Pancha-Tantrati-Sara, was most probably based on Usanas Danda-Niti, while the Pancha-Tantra, which is a collection of tales about politics written for the primary education of kings and would-be administrators, uses the word Naya-Sastra to refer to the literature. As explained in the Agni-Purana, political science is also known to have been borrowed from an author called Pushkara during the Vedic period.</p>

                                <h3>Vedic Period’s Philosophy Of Kingship</h3>
                                <p>The philosophy of kingship was developed during the Vedic period and is notably referenced in the Aitereya Brahmana. It claims that the Devas did not have a monarch at first. However, after regularly defeating the Asuras, they decided that the Asuras’ success was because a monarch commanded them. As a result, they decided to repeat the experiment and agreed to pick a monarch. Whatever the historical validity of this notion is, the crucial element to remember here is that kingship is thought to have been chosen. On the other hand, political authors held that the first monarch was chosen under particular conditions or a contract and that the original contract was always maintained afterwards. According to this idea, the election was required for internal administration, the authority of law on its own, and the people’s refusal to obey. This contractual monarchy theory, which was undoubtedly a reflex of the express republican theory of contract, found support in Vedic hymns and sons of the royal election, rituals of royal consecration based on elective principles, and the coronation oath, which required the king to swear that he would rule according to the law. Even after succession to the monarch became hereditary, the rituals were usually observed. According to these holy rites, the king was always an elected person who held office on the terms he agreed to in his coronation oath. Politicians’ contract idea was always believed in and accepted by both the ruler and the ruled. The monarch was elected by the people convened in the Samiti during the Vedic period. The people assembled are reported to unanimously elect him to rulership, following which the Samiti assigned him to hold the State. He will not tumble from his position since he is expected to smash his adversaries. The Atharva Veda has an entire election song.</p>
                                <p>The monarch becomes the single receiver of taxes from the people, according to the last stanza of a hymn in the Rig Veda matching the song of the election given above; he becomes the king of the people. The fact that there is only a sole taker indicates that the regular tax, as a royal duty, has already evolved. It was only the monarch who was entitled to it. After inheriting the throne, the new king gets a symbolic armlet called Mani from the assembled people and the king-makers, generally top bureaucrats or ministers (king-makers) The Treasurer, the Commander of the Army, the Gramani or township head, and others were prominent officials. Thus, the king-makers appear to be community or popular officers of the State who were recognized as rulers, the king being the top ruler among them. The election in this age looks pretty basic and business-like, yet it conceals a hidden philosophy. The people elect the king, who must complete specific obligations and is bestowed with certain benefits. He accepts his position as king from the people and the king-makers. He was in accord with his electors, and he might be removed from office and returned from exile. All of the political theory of kingship may be found in Vedic mantras. The truth was that the king’s position was a creation of the people and was held conditionally. Above him was the National Assembly, or Samiti, the true sovereign.</p>

                                <h3>Vedic Period’s Philosophy Of Kingship</h3>
                                <p>Aitareya brahmana mentions terms for the State such as Rajya, Bhaujya, Vairajya and Samrajya flourishing in different provinces of the country. It also mentions that the people in the vicinity of the Himalayas like the uttarkurus and uttaramadras have a Virat(kingless) type of the State and thus called(vi-rat). In the Later Vedic period, composite and confederate States also existed, consisting of two or more states but ruled by a common king. However, sufficient information is not available about the functioning of these states. Probably the jurisdiction of the central government of the confederate states was confined only to foreign policy and the declaration and prosecution of the war. Otherwise, each State retained its sovereignty. E.g. the kshudrakas and the Malavas formed a confederation to meet the invasion of Alexander the Great. The general for the joint army in a particular campaign was elected by the confederate states. In the campaign against Alexander the great, kshudrakas and Malavas had elected kshudraka generalissimo, famous for his skill and bravery.</p>

                                <h3>King And His Officials</h3>
                                <p>Hereditary kingship was a general observation in kingly succession. At times, however, a worthy monarch of his own choice from among the royal family members or the nobility could be selected by the king. The king represents the state, and all the state regulations derive their power and authority from him. The king, in his absence, would delegate his authority to a royal officer. 
                                     </p>
                                <p>The Yajurveda Samhitas and Brahmanas literature mention several elite officials known as ratnins (jewels). These ratnins formed part of the king’s council. Ratnins had a rather high status. The monarch had to go to their residence to perform ratnin oblation at the vajapeya sacrifice. Ratnins were most likely royal relatives, ministers, department heads, and courtiers. The chief supporters or defenders of the king (Viras) include his queen, son, brother, the Purohita(the royal chaplain), the Suta((commander of the royal army’s chariot corps), the Gramini(most prominent among the village headmen chosen to serve on the Ratnins’ council), the kshatrii, and the Samgrahitri((treasurer). Department heads such as Senani (commander in chief), Suta , Gramani, Sangrahita , Bhagadhuk (tax collector or finance minister), Kshatta (royal Chamberlain), Akshavapa (king’s companion at the game table), Palagala (king’s messenger) were also established. Further on as ratnins, some others include Govikartana (some senior official associated with the royal store of cattle), Taksha (carpenter), and Rathakara (chariot builder).The kings had dutas to facilitate communication between different states.The king did not possess a standing army. Tribal units were mustered in times of war.</p>
                                <p>Among the ratnins were the crowned queen and the favourite queen. This shows that queens in the Vedic period were more than just consorts of rulers; but also had a role in governance. The presence of Purohita is indispensable in an age that believed that the victories on the battlefield depended mainly upon the favour of gods to be secured through proper sacrifices. The Purohita and Senani, among all the officers under the king, played an important role.The senani discharged civil functions at times of peace. References to a large body of royal officials indicate the development of an administrative organisation in this period. However, the Purohita is above all these officers and acted as a councilor to the king. Officials who were not merely courtiers but also public functionaries suggest that there existed various administrative departments.</p>

Such a body existed during the time of Ramayana and also functioned under the administration of king kharavela of Orissa in the 2nd century BC. It has no major powers as it could neither veto Dasaratha’s plan to banish Rama nor induce the latter to return home as desired by them.</p>
